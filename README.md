Candela for Chrome Desktop
=============================================

Lovely, flickering candle-like animation for Holiday by MooresCloud.  
Uses simplex noise via the included noise.js file.

* Based on example code by Stefan Gustavson (stegu@itn.liu.se).
* Optimisations by Peter Eastman (peastman@drizzle.stanford.edu).
* Better rank ordering method by Stefan Gustavson in 2012.
* Converted to Javascript by Joseph Gentle.

Candela uses the super-fast UDP-based SecretAPI, which is documented at https://github.com/moorescloud/secretapi
